	The P variable gives a proportional response to the vehicle's cross-track error. This allows the vehicle to align with the desired path. The D variable takes the derivative of the crosstrack error in order to give a sloping and dynamic response to the change in the cross-track error over time. This smooths out the vehicle's approach to the desired path. The I variable takes the sum of all crosstrack errors in order to correct for imperfections in the control of the car and control for baseline error which P and D variables cannot account for. This prevents a static crosstrack error which would separate the vehicle from its desired path. 
	These parameters were tuned using twiddle, which takes each variable and cycles through them while adjusting them slightly in response to the change in the crosstrack error per adjustment. The code for twiddle can be found in my TWIDDLE.cpp file.
